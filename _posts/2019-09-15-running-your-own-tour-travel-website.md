Running a tourism business can be a pain especially if you are looking at getting all your clients online. In this post I will try to explain what I think makes a good website and what it requires to be successful.
Whether you are tech savvy or just a newbie at this, its always important to lay a good foundation for how your website is designed. Their are currently many ways one can get a  website up and running, some of which include;

* Drag &  Drop using website builders
* Extended blogs like wordpress, joomla or dupal
* Hiring a developer to design and build one from scratch.

I am going to make an assumption that you are an everyday person who knows how to use a computer effectively. In the following steps I will outline what you need to do

1. **Purchase domain name and a hosting account** A domain name is an online address where people can easily find you online, a hosting account is where all your online files with be stored. I would suggest selecting a name which easily reflects your service industry. This makes it easy to find and SEO friendly (Will explain this later).

2. **Choose a CMS for management of data and media** A content management system comes in handy if you are looking to simply edit a website like a word document. Wordpress in this case would be my natural choice, first of all it accounts for 30% of all websites running on the internet, secondly its popularity implies that you will have lots of developer who can edit and modify it to your taste; and that's only if the out of the box features do not satisfy your need. Lastly its functionality can easily be extended with a lot of free and premium plugins which is way cheaper than hiring a developer to improve or add functionality

3. **Hire a developer to design theme** In most cases, you will not need to do this since wordpress ships with a variety of themes but incase you need something more original. I prefer using s CMS becuase that way you you will not need to ever worry about a changing the content when you dont agree with a design.

This is all for now. I will be writing a followup article discussing Content Management & SEO.
